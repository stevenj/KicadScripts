# KicadScripts
Just some Kicad scripts

# A UserScripts directory

I made a directory for my own scripts in ~/.config/kicad/plugins
Then i make a softlink from /usr/share/kicad/scripting/plugins/ called UserScripts to it.

That way I am not mesing with the scripts provided by Kicad, and i can have my userscripts have my permissions.

# Debugging
Kicad scripts can be debugged using winpdb.

Follow : http://winpdb.org/docs/embedded-debugging/

It works.
